INTRODUCTION                                                        *sekme.nvim*

`sekme.nvim` is a chain-completion plugin that complements Neovim's own
completion functions. (See |ins-completion|)

I initially copied this chained completion idea from completion-nvim
(https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim).

`sekme.nvim` uses a list of |ins-completion| keys to rotate the completion
source. If one source doesn't provide any completion items, it switches to the
next one until a completion is found. It also leverages |completefunc|, but
it's just a source in the chain instead of a new one.

OPTIONS                                                          *sekme-options*
================================================================================

These options are only enabled if |options.nvim| is installed.
See https://github.com/Furkanzmc/options.nvim for installation details.

Global ~

completion_timeout                            *sekme-options-completion_timeout*

Defaults to 150. Determines how much time `sekme.nvim` waits before it tries
another source. You may want to reduce this timeout to a lower value for
filetypes that you don't have a language server for.

You can also use `b:sekme_completion_timeout` to customize this value.

completion_key                                    *sekme-options-completion_key*

Defaults to <Tab>.

You can also use `g:sekme_completion_key` to customize this value.

completion_rkey                                  *sekme-options-completion_rkey*

Defaults to <S-Tab>.

You can also use `g:sekme_completion_rkey` to customize this value.

abbvr_trigger_char                               *sekme-options-completion_rkey*

Defaults to `@`.

You can also use `g:sekme_abbvr_trigger_char` to customize this value.

LUA                                                                  *sekme-lua*

setup({opts})                                                      *options.set*

    Initialize the plugin. This will internally call
    |options.setup_completion| for each buffer.

    Parameters: ~
        {opts} (optional, table)
            - {completion_key} (optional, string): Defaults to <Tab>
            - {completion_rkey} (optional, string): Defaults to <R-Tab>. Used
              for reversing the completion order.
            - {abbvr_trigger_char} (optional, string): Defaults to `@`. If you
              are using a trigger key for your abbreviations, `sekme.nvim`
              will trigger the abbreviation instead of completion functions.
              This is useful for preventing collisions with actual words when
              you are using abbreviations.
            - {custom_sources} (optional)
                Each item in {custom_sources} table needs to have these keys:

                    - {complete} (function): A function to be called. The
                      parameters are lines and word to complete.
                    - {filetypes} (optional, string): When set, it's only
                      called for the given filetypes.

                These functions will be triggered when |completefunc| is the
                current |ins-completion| source.

                Example: >
                    function complete_work_days(lines, base)
                        -- lines is a list of lines in the current buffer. You
                        -- don't have to use it.
                        return {
                            { word = "Monday", kind = "Days" },
                            { word = "Tuesday", kind = "Days" },
                            { word = "Wednesday", kind = "Days" },
                            { word = "Thursday", kind = "Days" },
                            { word = "Friday", kind = "Days" },
                        }
                    end

                    require("sekme").setup({
                        custom_sources = {
                            {
                                complete = complete_work_days,
                                filetypes = { "markdown" },
                            },
                        },
                    })
